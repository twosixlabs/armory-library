# Overview

Charmory is the temporary name for the JATIC armory replacement. This name is
mostly for the use of the developers as we move function and code from Armory to
Charmory. Interim releases will be provided under this scaffolding name, although
most users will still `import armory` as there is no Python package "charmory".



# Installation & Configuration

```bash
pip install charmory
```

Will make the `armory` namespace available to your Python environment. In the open-source
version, the installation name was "armory-testbed" which provided also provided
the `armory` namespace.

## Conda
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml -n charmory
conda activate charmory
```


# Usage
See the documentation [here](https://jatic.pages.jatic.net/twosix/armory/).
