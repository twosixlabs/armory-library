# Overview

Armory-library is a pure Python library which allows the measurement of ML systems in
the face of adversarial attacks. It takes the years of experience gained and techniques
discovered under the [DARPA GARD program][gardproject] and makes it available to the
general user.


# Installation & Configuration

```bash
pip install armory-library
```

This is all that is needed to get a working Armory installation. However, Armory-library
is a library and does not contain any sample code. We provide examples in the
`armory-examples` repository which is released concurrently with Armory-library.

## Example programs

To install the examples, run:

```bash
pip install armory-examples
```

This will install the example code in your current Python environment and will add
a command `armory-examples`. This will list the available examples and allow you
to run them. For example:

```bash
$ armory-examples
mnist-vit-pgd
â€¦
$ armory-examples mnist-vit-pgd
# runs the example mnist-vit-pgd evaluation
```

The [example source code][example-src], along with the [Armory-library
documentation](docs/index.md) is a good place to learn how to construct your own
evaluations using armory-library.

# Getting Started

For those unfamiliar with machine learning topics in general, this is a notebook
with a more-detailed explanation of the various objects involved in this work.
It will walk through such topics as where to get datasets and models, and how to
set up an evaluation. The notebook can be run for free on Google Colab.

# Quick Look

We have provided an sample notebook using Armory to evaluate an MNIST classifier
in the presence of a Project Gradient Descent (PGD) attack. The notebook can be
run for free on Google Colab to get a taste of how Armory works.

# Documentation

The Armory-library documentation is [published on Read the Docs][docs-url] or
can be viewed directly in [the docs directory](docs/index.md) of this repository.

# The historic GARD-Armory

Armory-library is the successor to the [GARD-Armory research program run under
DARPA][GARD-Armory]. As that program is nearing its conclusion, that repository
will be archived sometime in 2024 and there will be no further development in
GARD-Armory by the time you are reading this sentence. The development teams
for both GARD-Armory and Armory-library can be reached at <armory@twosixtech.com>
