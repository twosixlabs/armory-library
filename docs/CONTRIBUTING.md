## How to Contribute

Pull-requests can be freely submitted but we suggest that you conform to our own
mechanical standards before submitting.

1. Your work should be based on the current `master/HEAD` commit.
2. Our static code analysis and formatting tools are opinionated and mechanized.
    Please run `pre-commit run --all-files` before submitting your pull-request.
3. New code should have accompanying unit tests.
4. Ensure that all unit tests pass before submitting your pull-request with
    `task test`.
3. Contact us at <armory@twosixtech.com> if you have any questions or to discuss
    your contribution.

## Documentation

We assume that contributors will be making small changes to the documentation files
that are in the code repository [`docs`](./) directory. If you are making larger
changes that would require more substantial changes to the documentation, you would
likely want to talk with us first to discuss your plans.
