# Scenarios
Armory is intended to evaluate threat-model scenarios.
Baseline evaluation scenarios are described below.
Additionally, we've provided some academic standard scenarios.


## Configuration Files
Scenario configuration files are found in the `scenario_configs` directory [here](scenario_configs).
The most recent config files are found in the `eval6` subfolder and older configs are found in the `eval5` and `eval1-4` subfolders.
There are also symlinks to representative configs found in the base of the `scenario_configs` directory.


## Base Scenario Class
All scenarios inherit from the [Scenario](https://github.com/twosixlabs/armory/blob/master/armory/scenarios/scenario.py) class.
This class parses an armory configuration file and calls its `evaluate` method to perform all of the computation for a given threat-models robustness to attack.
All `evaluate` methods save a dictionary of recorded metrics which are saved into the armory `output_dir` upon  completion.
Scenarios are implemented as subclasses of `Scenario`, and typically given their own file in the [Scenarios Directory](https://github.com/twosixlabs/armory/blob/master/armory/scenarios/).

Of particular note is the [Poison](https://github.com/twosixlabs/armory/blob/master/armory/scenarios/poison.py) class, from which all poisoning scenarios are subclassed.
More information on poisoning scenarios is documented [here](poisoning.md).

### User Initialization

When adding custom models, attacks, metrics, datasets, etc. to a scenario, it may be necessary to initialize or perform user-specific operations before loading.
For this purpose, there is a `user_init` method that is called at the beginning of `load` (but after scenario initialization).
In poisoning, this occurs right after random seed setting in `load`.

This uses the underlying scenario config field of the same name, `user_init`.
See [configuration](configuration_files.md) for the json specification.
An example config would be as follows:
```json
    ...
    "user_init": {
        "module": "import.path.to.my_module",
        "name": "my_init_function",
        "kwargs": {
             "case": 1,
             "print_stuff": false
        }
    }
}
```
Which would essentially do the following before loading anything else in the scenario:
```python
import import.path.to.my_module as my_module
my_module.my_init_function(case=1, print_stuff=False)
```
If `name` were `""` or `None`, then it would only do the import:
```python
import import.path.to.my_module
```

This could be helpful for a variety of things, such as registering `metrics` prior to loading or setting up custom meters.
For instance:
```python
def my_init_function():
    from armory.instrument import Meter, get_hub
    from armory import metrics
    m = Meter(
        "chi_squared_test",
        metrics.get("chi2_p_value"),
        "my_model.contingency_table",
    )
    get_hub().connect_meter(m)
```
Would enable measurement of a contingency table produced by your model.
This would require adding probe points in your model code to connect it (which doesn't need to be in the init block), e.g.:
```python
from armory.instrument import get_probe
probe = get_probe("my_model")

class MyModel(torch.nn.Module):
    ...
    def forward(x):
        ...
        table = np.array([[2, 3], [4, 6]])
        probe.update(contingency_table=z)
        ...
```


## Baseline Scenarios
Currently the following Scenarios are available within the armory package.
Some scenario files are tied to a specific attack, while others are customized for a given dataset.  Several are more general-purpose.
Along with each scenario description, we provide a link to a page with baseline results for applicable datasets and attacks.
More information about each referenced dataset can be found in the [datasets](datasets.md) document.

### Multimodal So2Sat Image Classification (Updated July 2021)
* **Description:**
In this scenario, the system under evaluation is an image classifier which determines local climate zone from a combination of co-registered synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and multispectral electro-optical (EO) images.  This Image Classification task gets its own scenario due to the unique features of the dataset.
* **Dataset:**

train/validation datasets and 17 classes of local climate zones.
* **Baseline Model:**
  * Armory includes a custom CNN as a baseline model.  It has a single input that stacks SAR (first four channels only,
representing the real and imaginary components of the reflected electromagnetic waves)
and EO (all ten channels) data. Immediately after the input layer, the data is split into SAR and EO data
streams and fed into their respective feature extraction networks. In the final layer, the two
networks are fused to produce a single prediction output.

  * Adversary objectives:

### Poisoning

For a complete overview of the poisoning scenarios, threat models, attacks, and metrics, see the [poisoning doc](poisoning.md).  Here, we will briefly summarize each scenario and link to the baseline results.

#### Poison base scenario (DLBD)

* **Description:** The base scenario implements a Dirty-label Backdoor attack (DLBD).  In this scenario, the attacker is able to poison a percentage of the training data by adding backdoor triggers and flipping the label of data examples.  Then, the attacker adds the same trigger to test images to cue the desired misclassification.  For a complete overview, see the [poisoning doc](poisoning.md).
* **Datasets:**
  Datasets for DLBD include but are not limited to:
  * GTSRB
  * Audio Speech Commands

#### Poisoning CLBD
* **Description:** This scenario implements a Clean-label Backdoor attack (CLBD).  In this scenario, the attacker adds triggers to source class training images, leaving the labels the same but also applying imperceptible perturbations that look like target class features.  At test time, adding the trigger to a source class image induces misclassification to the target class.  For a complete overview, see the [poisoning doc](poisoning.md).
* **Datasets:**
  Datasets for CLBD include but are not limited to:
  * GTSRB
* **Baseline Models:**
  Armory includes several models which may be used for this scenario:
  * [GTSRB micronnet](https://github.com/twosixlabs/armory/blob/master/armory/baseline_models/pytorch/micronnet_gtsrb.py)
  * [Resnet18](https://github.com/twosixlabs/armory/blob/master/armory/baseline_models/pytorch/resnet18.py)
* **Threat Scenario:**
  * Adversary objectives:
    * Targeted misclassification
  * Adversary Operating Environment:
    * Non-real time, digital evasion attack

## Creating a new scenario
Users may want to create their own scenario, because the baseline scenarios do
not fit the requirements of some defense/threat-model, or because it may be easier
to debug in code that you have access to as opposed to what is pre-installed by the
armory package.

To do so, simply inherit the scenario class and override the necessary functions.
An [example of doing this](https://github.com/twosixlabs/armory-example/blob/master/example_scenarios/audio_spectrogram_classification.py) can be found in our armory-examples repo.
