# TwoSix JATIC Sprint review 23-May-2023

  * Retrenchment effort
      * Adaptation of Armory datasets discontinued
      * Supplanting with jatic_toolbox datasets
      * Sprint extension to 6-June-2023 requested

We realized this week that our troubled attempts to cast Armory
datasets into JATIC were misguided. Because the Armory datasets
cover only well-established toy problems in ML (for example, MNIST)
that effort and code designed to adapt Armory to JATIC dataset protocols
(and vice versa) was of no ultimate benefit and carried needless
complexity forward. 

In light of this, we have begun incorporation of native JATIC toolbox
dataset protocols directly into core Armory. The cost of this retrenchment
is extending the Sprint out to 6-June.
