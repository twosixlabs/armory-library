# Dataset Transforms
A transform is a (preprocessing) function on a model. This class contains general data transform functions for experimentation, to include Bounded Boxes (and the conversion between different formats of these), the resizing, padding, rescaling, and normalization (into z-scores) of images, image classification transforms, and object detection transforms.
