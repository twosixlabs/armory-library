# Model Ingestion and Adaptation

As Armory requires the inputs and outputs of models to be highly-structured,
several utilities are provided to wrap models for task-specific objectives.

The following model wrappers are provided for image classification:

- [`ImageClassifier`](#armory.model.image_classification.image_classifier.ImageClassifier)

The following model wrappers are provided for object detection:

- [`ObjectDetector`](#armory.model.object_detection.object_detector.ObjectDetector)
- [`YolosTransformer`](#armory.model.object_detection.yolos_transformer.YolosTransformer)
- [`YoloV5ObjectDetector`](#armory.model.object_detection.yolov5_object_detector.YoloV5ObjectDetector)
