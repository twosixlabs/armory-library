# Software Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up your development environment on both Linux and Windows operating systems.

## Git Configuration & Setup

### Configuring Git

Make sure to follow GitLab's guide for [Using SSH Keys to communicate with GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/ssh.html).

Instructions for setting up Git on Ubuntu Linux are as follows:
  * Install Git with the following command:

      ```bash
      sudo apt-get install git
      ```

  * Configure Git to handle line endings with the following command:

      ```bash
      git config --global core.autocrlf input
      ```

All of these configurations set Git to normalize line endings to LF on commit, and on Windows, to convert them back to CRLF when files are checked out.

### Initial Setup
1. **Clone the repository**
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/twosixlabs/armory-library.git
  cd armory-library
  ```

2. **Install the packages**
  ```bash
  ./dev-install.sh
  ```

## Prerequisites

- Python installed (the version depends on your project requirements)
- VSCode installed
- Git

## Virtual Environment Setup and Project Installation

We use Python's built-in `venv` module to create virtual environments. This keeps our project's dependencies isolated from other Python projects.

In a terminal, navigate to your project directory and run the following commands:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv --copies venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Upgrade pip, and install the build and wheel packages
python -m pip install --upgrade pip build wheel

# Install the project with all dependencies, without compiling
./dev-install.sh
```

## Linting the Code

Before committing any code, we run a pre-commit script that lints the code to ensure it meets our coding standards:

```bash
python -m pre_commit # or just `pre-commit`
# or
task lint
```

## Building the Application

We use hatch to build our Python application into a wheel file:

```bash
hatch build --clean --target wheel
```

## Generating Documentation

We use mkdocs to build our project documentation:

```bash
task docs
```

## Running Unit Tests

```bash
task test
```

# Helpful VSCode Tips

  - You can select the Python interpreter used by VSCode by clicking on the Python version on the bottom-left of the status bar.
  - Use the Ctrl+Shift+P shortcut to open the Command Palette, where you can access all VSCode commands.
  - Use the Ctrl+ shortcut to increase the size of the text in the editor.
  - You can split your editor into multiple panes to work with multiple files at the same time. Use the Ctrl+\ shortcut to split the editor.
  - If you want to run a Python file in the terminal, you can right-click anywhere in the file and select 'Run Python File in Terminal'.
