# Setting Up VSCode for Python Development

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for Python development with a focus on machine learning.

## Prerequisites

- VSCode installed
- Python installed (Armory-Library requires at least version 3.8)

## 1. Installing Essential VSCode Extensions

VSCode provides a rich ecosystem of extensions that can make Python development smoother and more efficient. Here are some key extensions to install:

1. **Python** (`ms-python.python`) - Offers Python language support including IntelliSense, linting, debugging, code formatting, etc.
2. **Jupyter** (`ms-toolsai.jupyter`) - Provides Jupyter notebook support, interactive programming and computing.
3. **Python Test Explorer** (`LittleFoxTeam.vscode-python-test-adapter`) - Supports unit testing in Python.

To install an extension, follow these steps:

- Press `Ctrl+Shift+X` to open the Extensions view.
- Type the name of the extension in the search bar.
- Click 'Install'.

## 2. Setting Up the Python Environment

VSCode needs to be configured to use the correct Python interpreter for your project. To do this:

- Click on the Python version displayed in the VSCode status bar; this will ONLY appear when a Python file is open.
- Select the Python interpreter you want to use.

You can also configure the interpreter used by VSCode by modifying the `.vscode/settings.json` file in your workspace:

```json
{
    "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "/path/to/your/python"
}
```

*NOTE*: When setting the interpreter via the UI, VSCode saves your selection in a workspace-specific sqlite settings file under `~/.config/Code/User/workspaceStorage/`. That is intended to be a way to share settings but is ignored when you select the interpreter via the UI.

## 3. Configuring VSCode for Debugging and Tracing

To set up debugging in Python with VSCode, see the [Troubleshooting Guide](./troubleshooting.md#visual-studio-codes-debugger).

## 4. Configuring Jupyter Notebook Support in VSCode

With the Jupyter extension installed, you can create a new Jupyter notebook by clicking on the new file button in the Explorer view and giving the file a .ipynb extension.

## 5. Enabling Pair Programming in VSCode

To enable pair programming, install the "Live Share" extension. This allows you to share your workspace with others for collaborative work.


With these steps, you will have a robust and efficient Python development environment set up in VSCode.
