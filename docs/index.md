# Welcome to Armory Testbed

## Overview

ARMORY is a test bed for running scalable evaluations of adversarial defenses.
Models, datasets, and evaluation scripts can be pulled from external
repositories or from the baselines within this project.

Our evaluations are created so that attacks and defenses may be
interchanged. To do this we standardize all attacks and defenses as subclasses of
their respective implementations in IBM's [adversarial-robustness-toolbox](https://github.com/IBM/adversarial-robustness-toolbox)

## Dataset licensing
See [dataset_licensing.md](dataset_licensing.md) for details related to the licensing of datasets.
